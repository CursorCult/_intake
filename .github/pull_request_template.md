## Intake submission

- [ ] I added exactly one file under `submissions/`
- [ ] `project.repo` is the desired `CursorCult/<repo>` name
- [ ] `project.source` points to the canonical source repository
- [ ] `project.owner` is a GitHub username or team name that should own the repo
- [ ] `project.license` is accurate (no guessing)

### Notes for reviewers

- Does the name fit CursorCult conventions?
- Is the project in-scope for the org?
- Any security/licensing concerns?
